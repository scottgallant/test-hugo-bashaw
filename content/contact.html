<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Our desire is to be a community living God’s love, sharing God’s love.</p>

<p>We seek to follow in the way of Jesus by providing Worship, Sacrament, Education and Encouragement to our church family and to the Bashaw community; ministering to all those in need, including the lonely, the bereaved, the sick and the troubled; reaching out to youth, young families and the elderly in an inclusive ministry.  All this to the Glory of God.</p>
